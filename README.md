# Challenge-2

Copy and paste the VBA code into the developer side of the excel speadsheet (Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) and run.

  This VBA code worked perfectly for me expect one issue. I had to run the program twice to get the formatting correct. I checked with multiple people and they said the logic was correct and not to worry. I am not sure what else I can do. Hoping for feedback on that one. 


I did recive a little assistance with the code especailly getting the syntax right for pulling the greatest increase, deccrease, and volume. As well as matching them with the correct tickers.
